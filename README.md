Hello all Instant-Botterizers!!!

This is the Cad repo for IB, for the design team
Whenever you are making a change, make sure to push it to ur branch it occasionally, with my permission
After all commits are up to date, (call each other), you download the RAW file as you are viewing the file (from your branch). (MAKE A NEW BRANCH SHOWING YOUR FIX OR ADD)
**Delete all other instances of this file from your computer** and open the just-downloaded file. Edit and then commit to your branch occasionally.

Finally, with my permission, push to main. (You will need my approval (Ishaan))!!!
