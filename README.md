Hello Instant BOT CAD team,

this is your friendly overlord, Ishaan.
This is our repository for our CAD files in our first season as part of FTC, Into the Deep.

This is a protected repo, which means that any pushes have to be approved by me.

Steps for use:
First, download a file from the repo onto your computer, call everyone else to make sure it is the latest.
Then open it in INVENTOR.
Make edits, hotfixes, or whatever. ;)
Then when you are ready for it to be updated, UPLOAD A FILE in the repo.
You can write ur summary.
Then call me and ask for it to be approved.
When it is, then its pushed to MAIN
Then **DELETE THE FILE ON YOUR COMPUTER**
Always make sure you are editing the latest version of the file.

For them worriers out there:
Don't worry when you click upload a file, it will auto-replace the existing file and not do
hihi.iam
hihi.iam
hihi.iam

XD
